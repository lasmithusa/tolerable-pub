# CORRELATION PARAMETERS #
# (Relate independent variables to each other -- some go down as others go up)
# May be able to do via dependent variables -> dependent = Norm(mean, std.dev = f(independent_value))
# I.e. define a dependent distribution with a std. dev. dependent on corresponding value of another distribution (independent or dependent)
